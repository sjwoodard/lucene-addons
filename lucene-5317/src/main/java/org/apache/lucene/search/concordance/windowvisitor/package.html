<p>ConcordanceArrayWindowSearcher performs a search on an index
    and generates a ConcordanceArrayWindow for each hit. This can be
    very useful for synonym finding and other types of analysis.
</p>

<p>To use this searcher, clients can extend ArrayWindowVisitor or
    use one of the two currently available implementations:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li> CooccurVisitor -- calculates statistics on terms before and after the target term.</li>
    <li> TargetVisitor -- calculates statistics on the target term.</li>
</ol>
</p>
